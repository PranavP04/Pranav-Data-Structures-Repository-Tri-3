# Pranav Create Task Plan
For my create task plan, I am looking to create a wordle game that will incorporate all of the college board functions. In this game, there will be a grid with the dimensions of 5 by 5. In order to generate words, I will have to create a word cloud that will generate random words whenever the user decides to restart the game or completes a round. In the game, the user will have 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word. When the user enters a word, I will need to create a for loop that will loop through each letter of the word the user entered to make sure that the letter first and foremost is even a part of the word the user is trying to guess, next I will have to run an if statement that makes sure that the letter if in the word is in the correct spot. If the letter is in the correct spot, the tile will turn green, but if the letter is a part of the word but not placed in the correct spot, it will turn yellow. If the letter doesn't exist at all in the word it will turn grey. Once the user finishes the game, there will be an alert that pops up stating that the user has completed the game and all the tiles will turn green as a symbol of finishing the round. Finally, the user can reload the page to try the game again.

# College Board Requirements
I will use procedural abstraction in order to take in the letter from the user, then this letter will enter a for loop that will contain an if statement in order to make sure that the word/letter actually exists. Then, I will create a list in order to store the different words that will be displayed in the wordle game, this will also be combined with a random generator to make sure that the word being guessed will be in a random order so the user won't have any previous hints of what the word may be. Next, I will use iteration in order to loop through to make sure that the letter is actually part of the code. Once I loop through, I will need to use an if/else statement that changes the color of the tile to green if the letter guessed is in the word and in the correct spot, yellow if the letter is in the word but in an incorrect sport, and grey if the letter doesn't exist within the word at all. My goal is to try and complete this wordle assignment over the break as it will require intensive coding and also will take a lot of trial and error in order to complete it. I am going to receive some help from my tutor in order to complete this assignment as it may require me learning a few new things as this game might be complicated to create. I will use user input through allowing the user to enter letters to create a word.
