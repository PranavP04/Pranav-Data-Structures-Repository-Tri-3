       Over this week, my plan is to try and work on all the units regarding data and algorithms and programming. Within these units, my plan is to work on all the different quizzes that were assigned for these units and also watch all the videos for each unit section. Once I am done with this, I will do more practice using Khan Academy for all of these units.
